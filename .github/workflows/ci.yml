  # Optional: heavy backend integration tests that require models/TF are intentionally omitted
  # from the default CI workflow because they are large and slow to install on GitHub Actions.
  # If you want a full integration job, consider adding a separate workflow or a self-hosted runner
  # with the required GPU/CPU resources and cached model artifacts.
